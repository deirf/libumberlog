* 0.1.1 - <2012-04-02 Mon>

** Override __syslog_chk, even when compiled without fortification

In the first release, the library only exported and overridden
__syslog_chk function if it was compiled with fortification
enabled. This resulted in the library not working as expected on
systems where fortification was enabled (such as Debian and Fedora).

This release corrects that issue, and even by default, with
fortification disabled, the built library will work as expected on all
supported systems.

* 0.1.0 - <2012-03-26 Mon>

Initial release.
