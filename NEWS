* 0.1.2 - <2012-04-08 Sun>

** Portability fixes

Up until now, the library abused that passing va_list around without
copying works on various architectures. On others, that does not.

To remedy the issue, the library now parses format strings itself, and
copies va_list. This makes it work on all architectures, independent
on the internal implementation of va_list, and preserves both API and
ABI.

* 0.1.1 - <2012-04-02 Mon>

** Override __syslog_chk, even when compiled without fortification

In the first release, the library only exported and overridden
__syslog_chk function if it was compiled with fortification
enabled. This resulted in the library not working as expected on
systems where fortification was enabled (such as Debian and Fedora).

This release corrects that issue, and even by default, with
fortification disabled, the built library will work as expected on all
supported systems.

* 0.1.0 - <2012-03-26 Mon>

Initial release.
