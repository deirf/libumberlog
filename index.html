<h1 id="what">What?</h1>
<p>The libumberlog library serves two purposes: it's either a drop-in replacement for the <code>syslog()</code> system call, in which case it turns the default syslog messages into <a href="#an-example">CEE-enhanced messages</a>, with a CEE-JSON payload, and some automatically discovered fields. Or, it can be used as a stand-alone library, that provides a <code>syslog()</code>-like API, with the ability to add arbitrary key-value pairs to the resulting JSON payload.</p>
<h1 id="why">Why?</h1>
<p>The legacy <code>syslog()</code> interface, while simple, is starting to show its age. It was meant to be an interface to construct free-form messages, targeted at human readers. However, in this time and age, the amount of logs generated by a busy system is, especially by a central log server in a larger environment does not lend itself well to manual processing.</p>
<p>Instead, we rely more and more on programs to make sense out of the logs, to structure the free-form text into something that's easier to search and corellate, to filter on, and the existing interface does not make this easy. It wasn't written with computer-based post-processing in mind.</p>
<p>This library is an attempt to smoothly introduce structured logging to administrators and developers alike, by taking a legacy interface, <code>syslog()</code>, and improving on it a little. Not only by enhancing the existing function, for example with a high-resolution timestamp, but by providing an extended, but still similar API to developers, to allow them to add more structure to their logs.</p>
<h1 id="how">How?</h1>
<h2 id="an-example">An example</h2>
<p>One does wonder, how an example might look like, we're happy to oblige, and show one (word wrapped, for an easier read):</p>
<p>SSH Login:</p>
<pre><code>Mar 24 12:01:34 localhost sshd[12590]: @cee:{
    &quot;msg&quot;: &quot;Accepted publickey for algernon from 127.0.0.1 port 55519 ssh2&quot;,
    &quot;pid&quot;: &quot;12590&quot;, &quot;facility&quot;: &quot;auth&quot;, &quot;priority&quot;: &quot;info&quot;,
    &quot;program&quot;: &quot;sshd&quot;, &quot;uid&quot;: &quot;0&quot;, &quot;gid&quot;: &quot;0&quot;,
    &quot;host&quot;: &quot;hadhodrond&quot;, &quot;timestamp&quot;: &quot;2012-03-24T12:01:34.236987887+0100&quot; }</code></pre>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Apart from the autotools, a C compiler, and <a href="http://oss.metaparadigm.com/json-c/">json-c</a>, there are no other hard dependencies when building, except for a sufficiently modern system.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The library follows the usual autotools way of installation:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone git://github.com/algernon/libumberlog.git
$ cd libumberlog
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</code></pre>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>The library can either be used as an LD_PRELOAD-able shared object, in which case it overrides the system-supplied <code>syslog()</code> calls with its own, or as a proper library. In the latter case, please see the <a href="http://algernon.github.com/libumberlog/umberlog.html">API documentation</a> for more information.</p>
<p>In the former case, using the library is as easy as setting <strong>LD_PRELOAD</strong> prior to executing a program (if one wants to control this on a per-program basis), or adding the path to the installed library to <code>/etc/ld.so.preload</code>.</p>
<h2 id="non-goals">Non-goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>It is not a goal to support anything else but <code>syslog()</code> payload.</li>
<li>It is not a goal to go to great lengths to discover things about the running process: only a few things that are easily available, no matter how reliable this information may be.</li>
<li>It is not a goal to support complex values, or anything other than plain C strings.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="license">License</h2>
<p>This library is released under a two-clause BSD license, see the <a href="https://raw.github.com/algernon/libumberlog/master/LICENSE">LICENSE</a> file for details.</p>
